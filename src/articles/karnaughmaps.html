<p>
    There are some seriously neat ideas that underly Karnaugh maps.
</p>

<p>
    The basic problem they solve is that given a truth table, can you find a boolean function that has the same output
    for each input as the table.
</p>

<p>
    For example, given the table
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>Out</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    We want a function that takes three inputs, A, B, and C, and outputs what's in the <b>Out</b> column.
    How can we find that function?
</p>
<p>
    The first observation to make is that a boolean function can only output a 0 or a 1.
    One way to write a function is to explicitly list what combinations of A, B, and C, will result in a 1.
    For example, if you give me (0, 0, 0) for inputs to the table above, we can see from the first row that the output
    is a 1.
</p>
<p>
    So one way to write this function out is to say: "If you give me (0, 0, 0) or (0, 1, 1) or (1, 0, 0), then the
    function is true."
</p>

<p>
    Now our job is to convert those words into a boolean function, and it's surprisingly easy.
    In fact, we've basically wrote it down already.
    If we just convert the "or"s to logical symbols, we get $(0,0,0) + (0, 1, 1) + (1, 0, 0)$.
    (I am denoting $+$ as the OR operator. You may have seen it as $\lor$, but this is what my textbook and professor
    use, so it's easier to not fight it.)
    (Similarly, I will denote AND by multiplication, instead of $\land$)
</p>
<p>
    But this is still nonsense, because we have no notion of how to take the OR of this tuple.
    In other words, we need to convert my offhand notation for these inputs into some real notation.
    The first thing that we can see is that, because we have three things OR'd together, we need to convert these tuple
    things to some kind of boolean statement.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, this one is pretty straightforward too.
    We have three sets of inputs: (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0).
    If you give me an input, how can I tell that it's one of those special ones?
    (Answering that question is equivalent to finding the function).
</p>
<p>
    Well let's just take one of those.
    If you give me (0, 0, 0), how can I know you gave me (0, 0, 0)?
    Well the expression A'B'C' can only possibly be true for (0, 0, 0).
    If any of the inputs A, B, or C were equal to 1 then it would be equivalent to 1 AND 1 AND 0, which definitely
    doesn't evaluate to true.
</p>
<p>
    (But why can't we just look at it? Obviously (0, 0, 0) is equal to (0, 0, 0). The answer is that circuits can't
    really look at things,
    and circuits are really why we care about any of this)
</p>
<p>
    Then if we do that same process for each special input, and OR them together, we get an expression that says: "is
    the
    input you gave me equal to special input 1, or special input 2, or special input 3?"
    If so, return true.
</p>
<p>
    We can write that exact expression as: A'B'C' + A'BC + AB'C'.
    So if the input matches any of the special inputs, it will be converted to 1 AND 1 AND 1, and OR'd together with two
    0 values, so it will evaluate to true.
</p>
<p>
    And that is a perfectly comprehensive way to write out that table as a function.
    The function is then said to be in it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_normal_form">canonical
        disjunctive normal form</a>, if the jargon interests you at all.
</p>
<p>
    I think the idea of writing functions out in that way is spectacularly clever.
    I don't think I would have come up with it.
    Let's recap the idea:
<ul>
    <li>A boolean function can only output either a 0 or a 1</li>
    <li>If you just list out the possible inputs that produce a 1, you can turn any truth table into a function by just
        checking if the input to a function is among that list of inputs that should output a 1</li>
    <li>
        The way that we actually do that checking is by taking each input and creating a boolean expression that
        uniquely
        evaluates to true for only those inputs
        <ul>
            <li>So if the input is (1, 0, 1), then you convert that to AB'C, which will only ever be true if A and C are
                1, and B is 0</li>
            <li>It is absolutely impossible to make AB'C output 1 for anything other than that one specific input</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you take all of those expressions, ORing them together creates a statement that evaluates to true if and
        only if
        the function's input that you give it is within that list of inputs that should output a 1.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    That's all super neat.
    The final level on top of that is that listing every single input that maps to a 1 can get pretty tedious, and if
    you are building a circuit out of that function, you could be using a ton of gates to compute all of those
    expressions
    that evaluate to true for a single, unique value.
</p>
<p>
    It's possible that following that method could produce a circuit, or function, that is unnecessarily large.
    For example, let's look at another table.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>Out</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    If we do the "enumerate all inputs that should output 1" method, the function becomes
    A'B'C + A'BC + AB'C + ABC.
</p>
<p>
    You can factor out the C to get C(A'B' + A'B + AB' + AB).
    That parenthetical expression will always be true, because it has every single possible negation.
    C AND True evaluates to C, so we could have reduced the function to just C.
    No long list of terms required.
    A Karnaugh map will help us automate the process we just did.
    Instead of doing the two step process of making that normal form function and then algebraically reducing the
    function down,
    we can use a karnaugh map to skip straight to a reduced function.
</p>

<p>
    Let's draw out a Karnaugh map first and then explain it.
</p>

<p>
    We start by making a table with the same number of cells as rows in the truth table.
    Eventually, each row from the truth table its own cell in the Karnaugh map.
</p>
<table class="">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-top: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 2px;">
            <p></p>
        </td>
        <td style="border-top: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 2px;"></td>
        <td style="border-top: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 2px;"></td>
        <td style="border-top: 1px solid black; border-spacing: 2px;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    (If you have an even number of inputs, the table will be square, if you have an odd number of inputs, you make a
    rectangle that is as close to a square as possible)
</p>
<p>
    After that, you designate the axes of the table, and label each row and column.

                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    This means that the labels across the top are inputs of A and B, and the inputs along the side are for C.
    Why do you combine A and B?
    It's kind an arbitrary choice to pick A and B, we could have picked any two, but we need to combine some variables
    together.
    If we gave each variable its own axis, we would need a 3D map, and if we had 6 variables, we would need a six
    dimensional map!
</p>
<p>
    Now we populate the map with values from the truth table and designate the axes of the table, labeling each row and
    column.
    Each cell corresponds to a row from the truth table, so the top left corresponds to the row with inputs (0, 0, 0),
    and the one to the right of it is from inputs (0, 1, 0), and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The value in each cell is what is outputted from the truth table when you put in the corresponding input from the
    map.
    So the top right has A = 1, B = 0, and C = 0.
    The truth table with the row that has those values of A, B, and C, outputs a 0, so we write a 0 in that cell.

<p>
    Instantly we see that the output of this function is 1 whenever C is 1.
    However, that was a simple example, let's invent a totally different function so we can do some real work with
    Karnaugh maps.
</p>

<table class="ghost">
    <tr class="ghost">

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>

        </td>

</table>

<p>
    If this is our table, we need to figure out the magic function that created it.
    To repeat, this table means that the output of a function given A, B, and C, is written in the corresponding cell.
    For example, the top right cell is in the column labeled 10, so A = 1 and B = 0 for that whole column.
    The top right cell is in row C = 0, so the top right cell's corresponding input is (1, 0, 0).
    Because there is a 1 in that cell, our mystery function f(A, B, C) must output 1 for F(1, 0, 0).
</p>

<p>
    We're going to use the same strategy as before to create an expression for this function.
    We look at the map and see where the 1s are, and we are going to write an expression that tells you whether your
    input will output a 1.
    We're using this map because we can glean some useful information about how to most effectively express that.
</p>
<p>
    When two 1s are adjacent to each other (not diagonally), it means that there is something in common between them.
    For example, look at the fourth column (the one labeled 10).
    There are 2 adjacent 1s in that column.
    This tells us that when A = 1 and B = 0, the value of C actually doesn't matter, because whether C is 0 or 1, so
    long as A = 1 and B = 0, the value is true.
    So one of those uniquely true expressions we were thinking about ealier will be AB', because 1 AND 0' is the same as
    1 AND 1, which is true.
</p>
<p>
    We would have written that very same information before as AB'C' + AB'C, which algebraically reduces to AB' anyway,
    so we've conveniently skipped a step.
</p>

<p>
    As we find these groups of adjacent 1s, we can OR them together just as before to get an expression for the
    function.
</p>
<p>
    The other pair of adjacent 1s is in the first row.
    We see that C is constant between them, and A is constant, but B changing doesn't do anything.
    So when C = 0 and A = 0, no matter what B is, the output will be 1.
    So the expression from those two 1s is A'C'.
</p>
<p>
    So when we OR those together, we get AB' + A'C', which is a nicely reduced function.
</p>
<p>
    I've skipped a crucial part of the explanation so far.
    How did we label the rows and columns?
</p>
<p>
    The key idea behind Karnaugh maps that let us eyeball these reductions is that two adjacent 1s have a variable they
    don't care about.
    For example, if ABC and ABC' are both 1, they will be adjacent in the map, and the value of C doesn't matter, i.e we
    can factor out the AB
    to get AB AND (C OR C'), which is equivalent to AB.
</p>
<p>
    We label the rows and columns by gray code, then, because we want adjacent 1s to be separated by only a single
    changed variable.
    Doing this allows us to find variables we don't care about,
    Gray code is specifically designed so that consecutive gray code values are separated by only 1 bit.
    So we begin the labeling with <b>00</b>, and then add 1 to get <b>01</b>, then we go to <b>11</b>, which changes
    only the leftmost bit, and then we go to <b>10</b>.
    Each of those changes is only a single bit.
    That way, adjacent values in the map mean that the inputs are identical for all but one variable.
    That way, when 1s are next to each other, we know that they don't depend on that one variable we don't care about,
    and we can eliminate it from the expression.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you have a row of 3 1s, then there is a change of two variables between the first and the third 1.
    Because two variables change, we can't get any meaningful information out of those 1s being adjacent.
    This results in us not caring about anything other than groups of 2 adjacent 1s.
</p>
<p>
    However, there is one exception.
    If you have a line of 1s that spans every value of two (or more) variables, then it's totally possible you just have
    more than 1 variable you don't care about.
    For example, consider the following map:
</p>
<table class="ghost">
    <tr class="ghost">
        <td></td>
        <th class="ghost">AB</th>

                    <th>10</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        0
                    </th>
                    <td>
                        <p>1</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>1</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

            </table>

<p>
    There is a row of 4 adjacent 1s, across the whole first row.
    So no matter what A or B are, so long as C is 0, the output is 1.
</p>
<p>
    If there were 3 variables, that would need to be 8 1s long.
    4 variables requires 16, and so on.
    As a general pattern, you can only get useful information in groups of 1s that have an amount of 1s that is a power
    of 2.
    If your group is 2<sup>n</sup> 1s long, it represents that you don't care about n variables.
    And if n = 0, then you end up doing the exact same process as we did earlier!
    You're just enumerating all possible outputs of 1 with no simplification.
</p>

<p>
    To recap:
<ul>
    <li>
        Write out a square (or as close to square as possible) table with a number of cells equal to rows in your truth
        table
    </li>
    <li>
        Number each row and column in gray code, so that each adjacent cell's input differs by only one variable
    </li>
    <li>
        Fill in values in the cell from the table
    </li>
    <li>
        Find adjacent groups of 1s, with length equal to a power of 2
    </li>
    <li>
        Write an expression that is true for any member of that group by omitting the variables you don't care about,
        and forcing the constant inputs to be 1s
    </li>
    <li>
        OR together all of the expressions, and you have a reduced function
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    And the key ideas behind the map are that:
<ul>
    <li>Adjacent cells have inputs that differ by only one variable</li>
    <li>If you have adjacent cells with 1s in them, it means that those 1s can be expressed without the variable that
        changes between those two adjacent cells</li>
    <li>By writing out those expressions, we don't include any useless information, so we get a simplified expression
        for the function</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    We'll finish up with one problem to demonstrate all of this.
</p>

<p>
    Given the following truth table,
    find a function that matches the table.

<p>
    The two groups we'll use are highlighted.
    Notice that we have to use two groups.
    If we included all 4 1s into a single group, we would change more than a single variable per group.
    If they were all in a line this would be fine,
    because the group size is a power of 2 and all cells are adjacent, but because they are not all adjacent
    we change too much information within the group to get anything useful out of it.
</p>

<p>
    The yellow group changes the value of A between them, which means that they are independent of A.
    We can identify those two cells with the expression BC', so for B=1 and C=0, the output will be 1.
</p>
<p>
    The blue group only changes the value of B, so the expression there is A'C, so that any input for A=0 and C=1 will result in 1.
</p>
<p>
    By ORing those two together, we get BC' + A'C, which gives us a completely simplified expression of the function.
</p>
