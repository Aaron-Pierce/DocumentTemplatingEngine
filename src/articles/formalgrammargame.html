!{makeTitle}[The Formal Grammar Game][Fall 2021]

<p>
    I thought context-free grammars seemed like the perfect way to think about
    some kind of game about making spells or potions or something,
    where you represent nonterminals as slots to be filled with other
    potion ingredients or runes or things like that.
</p>
<p>
    That's not what this game is. I didn't have a clear idea of what
    I wanted the game to be, so I made the base system of defining a grammar
    and letting the player apply the productions to a string.
    While testing that out, it turned out to be pretty fun to design
    puzzles, which was enough for me, so I just kept that system as-is
    and made a more abstract puzzle game around it.
