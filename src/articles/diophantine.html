    My arcade basketball goal can display any two digit natural number, and I can prove it thanks to some long dead guy.
</p>

<p>
    The goal has a 60 second timer and a display that can show two digits.
    In the first 45 seconds all shots are worth 2 points, and in the last 15 seconds they're worth 3 points.
</p>

<p>
    The number on the display can be calculated as
    \( 2x + 3y = D\)
    where $x$ is the number of two point shots you made, $y$ is the number of 3 point shots you made,
    and $D$ is your final score that will be displayed.
    How can we be sure that D can be any natural number? (101 is displayed as 1, because there are only two digits in the display)
</p>

<p>
    The above equation is an example of a Diophantine Equation, which is an equation that only cares about integer inputs and outputs.
    (Diophantus is the long dead guy in question).
    We only care about integer inputs and outputs because you can't make half a shot, so you also can't finish with half a point, too.
</p>
<p>
    Only caring about integer inputs and outputs ensures that the equation always makes sense, but it adds some difficulty in working with the equation.
    If we let that equation vary over all real numbers, for instance, $D$ can easily take on any value by letting $y=0$ and letting $x=\frac{D}{2}$.
    However, if $x$, $y$, and $D$, are all integers, then $x=\frac{D}{2}$ is only sometimes allowed, namely when $D$ is even.
</p>
<p>
    That insight is still useful, though.
    We've given a language to the intuitive understanding that we can easily score any even score on the basketball arcade game.
    You just shoot half of your desired score as baskets, and we know that's mathematically possible because our Diophantine Equation
    has a solution for any $D$, which is $x = \frac{D}{2}, y = 0$.
</p>
<p>
    What about the odd numbers, then?
    If they're a multiple of 3 then we can also get to them by the same logic.
    But there are a lot of numbers that aren't a multiple of 3 or 2, like 7, or 11, or 17.
    There are a couple of tricks you could employ to get from here to a definite answer.
    One of them is that by subtracting 3 from any odd number, you get an even number, and we can always make an even number, so a sort of algorithm emerges.
    If your desired score is even, we can do it, and if it's not even, we will shoot one three-pointer, and the remaining balance will have to be even,
    so we can just shoot two-pointers to get that score.
</p>
<p>
    The Diophantine way to solve this problem is to assert that the greatest common factor of 3 and 2 is 1,
    so you can therefore reach every number.
    Let's explore why any of that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
    First off, imagine that the three-pointers didn't exist for a second.
    We can only reach even numbers, because we only have a multiples of 2 to work with.
    Similarly, if we had two-pointers and six-pointers to shoot, we still can only reach even numbers because 6 is itself a multiple of 2.
    So if we want to get to an odd number, we need some of the shots to be worth an odd number, 
    because if they're both worth an even number, then it's impossible to finish with an odd score.
</p>
<p>
    This pretty naturally leads us to want one of our scores to be even, and the other to be odd.
    However, we'd be missing quite a lot if we just left it at that.
    For example, if we had six-pointers and three-pointers, we have an even and odd pair, but we can't reach every number,
    because no matter how we combine three-pointers and six-pointers, our final score will always be a multiple of 3.
    We can prove that as follows:
    \[ 3x + 6y = 3(x + 2y) \]
    So our score will be 3 times some number, so it will necessarily be a multiple of 3.
</p>
<p>
    So if we pick any two numbers that share a factor, then we can pull that factor out of the whole equation, 
    and it will force the equation to only have solutions that are a multiple of that factor.
    For example, the general form of our basketball equation is $ax + by = D$.
    Where a and b are the two possible point values for a basket.
    So for the initial basketball equation, $a = 2$ and $b = 3$, representing that we can shoot two-pointers and three-pointers.
</p>
<p>
    If $a$ and $b$ share a factor, then they can be represented as follows:
    \[ a = nc \]
    \[ b = mc \]
    Where $c$ is the common factor, and $n$ and $m$ are some integer.
    So in our three point and six point case, we get
    \[ a = 1(3)\]
    \[ b = 2(3)\]
    So $c=3$, because 3 is the common factor, and $n$ and $m$ are chosen to make the equation work out, there's nothing particularly special about them.
</p>
<p>
    If $a$ and $b$ share this factor, then we get locked onto a rail.
    We can only slide up and down by multiples of $c$.
    However, if $c$ is 1, then the rail that we're stuck on is actually just all of the integers, which is very convenient.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, if $a$ and $b$ do not share a factor, then our answer can be any number, because any number is a multiple of 1.
    By "do not share a factor", I really mean that they share only 1, because 1 is a factor of everything.
    Because $a$ and $b$ share only 1 as a factor, we say that $a$ and $b$ are coprime.
    Similar to a prime number being prime because its only factors are 1 and itself,
    coprime numbers are coprime because between the factors of those numbers there is nothing in common.
</p>
<p>
    Having gone through all that, it reveals a few elements of Diophantine equations:
    <ul>
        <li>They may not have solutions for all inputs/outputs</li>
        <li>They will have a solution if the coefficients are coprime (with some trivial exceptions)</li>
        <li>They will have a solution if the GCF of the coefficients is a factor of the output (i.e. $D$ is a multiple of $\text{GCF}(a, b)$)</li>
    </ul>
    We know all of this is true because the coefficients sharing a factor means that your output will be confined to being a multiple of that common factor,
    like an inescapable doll from a horror movie or something.
    And this factor is horror-like because you can factor it out of the whole equation, 
    so your result will be that common factor times some integer made up of some number of $a$s plus some number of $b$s,
    which must be a multiple of that common factor.
</p>
<p>
    Knowing whether there is a solution or not can save you some work, or answer some questions about basketball,
    but actually calculating solutions to Diophantine Equations can be a little less than straightforward.
    With real numbers, we have the luxury of being able to divide any number we want by any other number, 
    and not really caring about what happens.
    In Diophantine land, though, decimal points are illegal and unhelpful.
</p>
<p>
    Strategies to find solutions are not particularly universal, nor general.
    They may be, like this article, incomplete.
    If you are reading this very sentence, I haven't published the finished version yet.
    Sorry if you made it this far and there's no conclusion.
