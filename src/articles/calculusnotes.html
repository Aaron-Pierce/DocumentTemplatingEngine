!{makeTitle}[Notes on Calculus III - Fall 2020]
<br>

<p>
    These were the first set of LaTeX compiled notes I took for a class and they were extremely helpful in learning and
    understanding the material.
    I they have proven useful enough that I will continue to compile notes like this in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Section 4 is likely the most notable/useful section, where I spent a lot of time understanding why 3 dimensional
    optimization works, namely why using the determinant of the hessian makes any sense.
</p>
<p>
    Section 6 is somewhat incomplete as the semester finished, but there is some nice intuition to be gleaned from
    section 6.4 on Green's theorem as well.
    Most of the content in that section (and most of the others) are from Grant Sanderson's KhanAcademy videos on multivariable calculus, and are probably worth watching instead of reading these notes anyway.
